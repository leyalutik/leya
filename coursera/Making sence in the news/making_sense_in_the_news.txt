*** Why news literacy matters ***

The digital era confronts us with four critical challenges.

1) it's difficult to sort out the reliable from the fabricated information because it's huge.

2)New communication technologies create, then virally spread any "autoritative" content.

3) Accuracy is losing to the speed of releasing content. 

4)The Internet and social media shows us the information that supports our beliefs.

News literacy matters because we should know how to recognize the difference between journalism and other kinds of information and between journalists and others who disseminate information.

Individuals with good news literacy skills can analyze the difference between assertion and verification, and between evidence and inference.
