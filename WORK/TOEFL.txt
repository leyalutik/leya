I think this question requires more details.
When you are a student, is one answer.
When you are a pupil is another.
answer, generally you are a concious man and you know what classes are important for you and what are not. 
And in this case you don't need such requitements for the class precense.
From other hand pupils need to be present because they are too little for making desicion.
In conclusion I can just say that there is no defenite answer for this topic.
